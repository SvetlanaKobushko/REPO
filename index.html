  <h2>Education</h2>
  <p>My education is a big part of my personality. It is what made me as I am today.</p>
  <h3 id="school">School</h3>
  <p id="demo" class="schoolyears">I have graduated the Nazarbayev Intellectual School (widely known as NIS) of the city Karaganda. At school, I placed a big emphasis on the quality of my knowledge, which allowed me to receive a golden medal with straight-A transcript.</p>
  <p class="schoolyears">Apart from good academic performance, I tried hard to be social and to contribute to my community. I was an active participant of school events, organised and lead the UNESCO club and held MUN conferences (Model United Nations). In the tasks that I performed starting from teenage years, I put my effort to make them perfect or at least decent, being responsible for myself and my team. I was a fair and energetic leader, creating a welcoming and productive atmosphere in my team.</p>

  <h3 id="university">University</h3>
  <p id="zoom" class="uniyears">My lifelong academic endeavours helped me to get to my dream university - the Nazarbayev University, located in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana. It is probably the best university in the country, at least judging from the prestige it earns both around applicants and employers. As of 2022, I am a 4th-year student of the School of Sciences and Humanities, studying World Languages, Linguistics and Culture. Interestingly, my initial major was Political Science and International Relations, however, I changed my major on the 3rd year of studies. I listened to my heart and decided that my particular talent lies in learning languages, analyzing texts and creative writing, so this decis ion required some courage from me.</p>

  <h3>Future Education</h3>
  <p class="uniyears">One of the main values I hold is lifelong learning and constant self-development, so I am to pursue my studies on Master's programm. A potential field that I am interested in is inclusive education. My professional career (about which you learn more following this link) is tightly related to this field of studies. I believe that modern education systems need massive improvements, one of the most important of which is creating a welcoming and supportive environment for students with diverse backgrounds.</p>

  <div id="zoom2" class="column" style="background-color:#F4B9B8;">
    <h2>Work</h2>
  	<p>My professional career represents my values and stance in the future.</p>
    <h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
    <p class="job">While still studying in my last year at school, I tried myself in tutoring. My strongest skill was English language, so I applied to a then-not-so-popular online school SkyEng. It was shocking and surprising at the same time to receive the offer. I was teaching teenagers from 10-17 years old on an online platform. For me, teaching was surprisingly pleasurable activity, and my part-time job became my life passion. Today, I've been teaching for almost 4 years and have conducted over 2500 lessons. The list of my students' achievements and positive feedback is big enough for me to understand that I have a particular inclination towards pedagogy, so it is now the basis of all my future plans. </p>
    <img class="skyeng" src="skyeng.png" alt="skyeng">
    <h3 id="eddesign">EdDesign</h3>
    <p class="job">In my work, I try to improve every possible aspect of the lesson. One of the most interesting and important thing for me as a teacher is the lesson organisation. The topic, tasks, workload, entertainment - all these are crucial parts for a successful lesson. When I disliked the tasks offered on the platform, I invented the new ones by myself. Judging by the quality of knowledge of my students and their positive feedback, I understood that educational degin is the field that I can excel in. I took a course in an online university called "Educational Programmes Methodist", in which I learnt the theoretical background and rules of high quality teaching.</p>

    <p class="quote"><em><b>"Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself” – Chinese Proverb</b></em></p>


    <p class="job">Combining my teaching experience, gained knowledge and natural creativity, I began a steady process of climbing up the career ladder, now in the direction of Educational Design. Firstly, I created my own course in teaching English Grammar and I have tested it on a number of students. Having received the feedback, I decided that I was ready to try something bigger and I began collaborating with an online school created by a young Kazakhstani entrepreneur. Dixi School gave me the opportunity to show my talent in designing the course for IELTS preparation. It was the biggest project I have completed so far, and in a short period of time, I have designed an intensive 30-days IELTS preparation marathon. Now, Dixi School is running the marathon periodically and helps hundreds of students to prepare for IELTS.</p>
  <h3>Future Prospects</h3>
  <p class="job">After finishing my Master's degree, I plan to continue working in the field of Educational Design and create effective, optimized and interesting programs for students learning any subject. I also believe it is important to stay a practitioner in pedagogy,meaning that I will continue conducting lessons and catching up on the demands of my students.</p>

<!--HOBBIES COLUMN -->

  <div id="zoom3" class="column" style="background-color:#85D2D0;">
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  	<p>My interests are really diverse. I want to live my life at full before I die.</p>
    <h3>Open mind</h3>
    <p class="hobby">I have spent the most part of my youth pursuing studies and career, and never really had time and chance to try interesting activities. I decided that in the course of my life, I will try different hobbies. In my list, there are over 30 skills and crafts that I want to try learning, and by far, I have tried sewing clothes, playing a guitar, ballet, embroidery, and crochet. </p>

    <h3 id="crochet">Crochet</h3>
    <p class="hobby">One of the latest activities that I am obsessed with is crocheting. In particular, I crochet toys. It is unbelievable how much peace and satisfaction it gives me to be sitting at one place and making something beautiful with my own hands. All my projects are special, because I give them away as presents to my loved ones. I like to think that I put into my hand-made toys a little piece of my soul, so the gift receivers really appreciate them. Look at some of my latest works.</p>
